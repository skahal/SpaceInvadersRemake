    /// There's a couple of ways to specify display options for a vfw object:
    /// 1- Per-instance: By collapsing the script header and using the display popup
    /// 2- Global: By VFWSettings.asset (you can go to it via Tools | Vexe | VFWSettings)
    /// 3- Object Hierarchy: This is what this example demonstrates. Overriding GetDisplayOptions is a mixture between the last two.
    ///                      Say you like the global options, but you want to apply different settings for your 'BaseAIController'
    ///                      and anything that inherits it. You can override GetDisplayOptions in the base controller so that any child
    ///                      class will get the same options. Note that you could still change the display via the popup under the script header.
    ///                      It's just that GetDisplayOptions will act as the inital/default/start options when your object is first created.
